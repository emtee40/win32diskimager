Build Tools

This is an archive of the tools used to build older versions of Win32DiskImager.  Since we use only
open source tools, they tend to change (often in incompatible ways).  This archive
Helps to ensure that users are able to rebuild Win32DiskImager.

Win32DiskImager version 0.9 and below:
qt-win-opensource-4.8.4-mingw.exe
qt-creator-windows-opensource-2.6.1.exe
mingw-get-inst-20120426.exe

Installer:
isetup-5.5.3.exe

For newer releases, we are currently using QT 5.7.1 with MinGW 5.3.0, which can be installed with the QT online installer app from http://qt.io.
